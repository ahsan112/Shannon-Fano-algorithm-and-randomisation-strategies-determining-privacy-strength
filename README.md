# Implementation of the Shannon-Fano algorithm and randomisation strategies to determine privacy strength.


### This was part of the Information Engineering Module: Semester 1.
There were 2 tasks:

### Question 1: Implement the Shannon-Fano algorithm to compress and decompress a given string. Output the result of the compressed and decompressed value to individual text files.
    output:
    - histogram with the probability and occurrence of each character of the the given string
    - encoded value of the given string using Shannon-Fano  coding
    - decoded value of the encoded string

### Question 2: Using the concept of mutual information, implement two randomisation strategies (uniformed and un-uniformed) to determine their privacy strength (information gain).
    output:
    - Implementation of 2 randomisation strategies successfully to determine the most efficient algorithm to use for privacy strength.
